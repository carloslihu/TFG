The security forces and bodies usually deal with the task of finding crime suspects of a completed crime, or in other cases, to find the victim of a disappearance.
To solve these crimes, they usually just start with an approximate location of the crime scene, or with the victim's phone number.
Thus, having access to a phone call and antenna registry, it should be easier to solve these crimes.


This project is developed in this context, as it consists of designing an app that provides an analyst with information to identify possible suspects of a crime given the approximate location and the time interval in which that crime was committed.
In addition, it allows the user to see the locations and path that a given phone number follows to establish its whereabouts and, in the case of the suspects, to identify possible accomplices to the crime.

To tackle this issue, a data insertion module has been developed to insert data in a database with a configurable format. 
Also a web interface has been developed. In this interface, through forms, queries in the database can be done.
The results of the query are shown through a Google Maps interactive map, where data can be visualized in detail when clicking on the different map locations.
